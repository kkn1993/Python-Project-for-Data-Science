# Python-Project-for-Data-Science
This repo is from IBM specialization, the module where I applied Python fundamentals, Python data structures, and worked with data in Python. By working on a real project, I modeled a Data Scientist or Data Analyst's role, and built a dashboard using Python and popular Python libraries in a Jupyter notebook.
